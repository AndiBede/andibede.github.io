Research interest
=================

In our laboratory we investigate via NMR diffusometry and relaxometry techniques the dynamics of liquid molecules at the interface of porous media and under confinement conditions. The porous media under study have nanometer or micrometer pore size and may be fully or partially saturated with fluids. The investigations are done at different temperatures and resonance frequencies. The porous systems currently under study are: porous glasses, polymeric nanocapsules used in controlled drug delivery, ultra strong concrete samples, porous ceramics with magnetic impurities, biomaterials with applications in medicine. Other materials of interest are: lubricants, fuels, catalysts, zeolites, ionic liquids, liquid crystals, rubber. Using NMR relaxometry and diffusometry techniques in the investigation of fluids confined inside porous media it is possible to extract information about pores dimension and their connectivity. Other information that can be extracted refers to ageing and alteration processes of different materials such as rubber, polymers, lubricants or food. In our laboratory we are also interested in developing of new NMR techniques suitable for the investigation of systems with a high content of magnetic impurities (concrete, rocks, soils, different building materials).
