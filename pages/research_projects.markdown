Research interest
=================

In our laboratory we investigate via NMR diffusometry and relaxometry techniques the dynamics of liquid molecules at the interface of porous media and under confinement conditions. The porous media under study have nanometer or micrometer pore size and may be fully or partially saturated with fluids. The investigations are done at different temperatures and resonance frequencies. 

The porous systems currently under study are: porous glasses, polymeric nanocapsules used in controlled drug delivery, ultra strong concrete samples, porous ceramics with magnetic impurities, biomaterials with applications in medicine. Other materials of interest are: lubricants, fuels, catalysts, zeolites, ionic liquids, liquid crystals, rubber. Using NMR relaxometry and diffusometry techniques in the investigation of fluids confined inside porous media it is possible to extract information about pores dimension and their connectivity. Other information that can be extracted refers to ageing and alteration processes of different materials such as rubber, polymers, lubricants or food. 

In our laboratory we are also interested in developing of new NMR techniques suitable for the investigation of systems with a high content of magnetic impurities (concrete, rocks, soils, different building materials).

Research projects of the group
------------------------------

  * **[Project PN II ID PCE 3-0238/ 2011-2014] (http://idei305.weebly.com/)**: Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of surface effects on dynamics of molecules confined inside porous media with magnetic impurities. Description: Porous ceramics with controlled amount of magnetic impurities are produced and characterized. The role of internal gradients in NMR measurements of molecules at the interface of such samples is investigated. This allows a better interpretation of the measured data and the development of new techniques (the role: project director).

  * **[Joint research project] (http://www.tu-ilmenau.de/techphys2/)** with Technical University Ilmenau, Germany (funded by the [Alexander von Humboldt] (https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/start.html) foundation) 2011-2014: Molecular dynamics during the phase transition of liquids confined inside porous media. Description: The surface effect on mobility of molecules confined inside porous media is studied both as a function of temperature and their polar/nonpolar character. The saturated and partially saturated conditions are considered. The case of unfrozen layer in porous media is investigated (the role: project director).

  * **Project PN2-NANOQMED 61-002/2007-2010**: Obtaining and characterization of new target nano-medicines with naftochinonic active substance. Description: In the frame of the project new polymeric capsules containing drugs of naftochinonic nature were produced and characterized with respect to their release properties and thermal stability. Biological tests of these encapsulated drugs were also performed by our partners (the role: project director).
Project CEEX MATNANTECH 58/2006-2008: NMR studies of molecular dynamics inside polymeric nanocapsules. Description:  In the frame of the project new core-shell polymeric capsules to be used as drug carriers were produced and characterized with respect to their stability and transport properties of the polymeric shell (the role: project coordinator).

  * **Joint research project** with Ulm University, Germany  (Project funded by the Alexander von Humboldt foundation) 1.05.2003-30.04.2008: Transport und Kernspin-Relaxationsphänomene in Porösen Medien”. Description: The diffusional mobility and the flow of molecules inside saturated and partially saturated porous media is studied  using NMR imaging, diffusomentry and relaxometry techniques  (the role: project director).

  * **Grant CNCSIS 411/2004** (financed by the Romanian Ministry for Education and Research) 1.01.2003-31.12 2005: Diffusion phenomena in partially saturated porous media investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance. Description: The role of the vapor phase to the effective diffusion coefficient in porous media under partially saturated conditions is investigated. The observation limits of the vapor phase enhancement are established (the role: project director). 

  * **Project CERES 4-36/4.11.2004** (financed by the Romanian Ministry for Education and Research) 15.11.2004-15.11.2006: Principles and unconventional aspects of NMR diffusometry of confined liquids. Description: The role of the internal gradients in diffusion measurements with conventional techniques is discussed. The solutions to avoid internal gradient effects on diffusion measurements are proposed (the role: project director).

  * **Grant CNCSIS type A/ 1292/2006** (financed by the Romanian Ministry for Education and Research)1.03.2007-15.09.2008: Dynamics of polar and non polar molecules under confinement in nanometric and micrometric pores .Description:The dynamics o water and cyclohexane molecules under confinement conditions inside porous glasses (Vycor, VitraPor) is monitored using NMR diffusometry and relaxometry techniques. The effect of the polarity on molecular dynamics is discussed (the role: project director).
